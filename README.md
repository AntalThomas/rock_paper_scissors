TOP Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors JS major project     28/08/2022-29/08/2022

For this project we were required to create a website from scratch where you could play a game of rock, paper, scissors
    in the console. 

I enjoyed this project and found it quite easy and free flowing throughout each part of the project.
If I were to improve the project I would add a GUI like like the higher up voted projects on the TOP website.


Revisiting Rock, Paper, Scissors                        05/09/2022
We are required to create a UI for the RPS game we previously created using what we learnt previously
    DOM manipulation and Events.

I'm really happy I was able to get everything working the way I wanted and was also able to clean up the code a little bit
    so that most of the repetitive code is using functions. I can still improve the way the website looks but for now I'm
    just focusing on the coding and will come back at a later time and improve the visuals.
