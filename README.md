TOP Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors JS major project     28/08/2022-29/08/2022

For this project we were required to create a website from scratch where you could play a game of rock, paper, scissors
in the console. 

I enjoyed this project and found it quite easy and free flowing throughout each part of the project.
If I were to improve the project I would add a GUI like like the higher upvoted projects on the TOP website.
